# Toxic Comments Classifier
Discussing things we care about can be difficult. The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. Platforms struggle to effectively facilitate conversations, leading many communities to limit or completely shut down user comments.

### This project aims to build a Multi-label Classification model capable of detecting different classes of toxicity for each comment. A comment could belong to more than one or none of the categories - Toxic, Severe_toxic, Obscene, Threat, Insult and Identity_hate
